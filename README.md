# GTsciences_Drupal_profile

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/konfuzed/gt_drupal_profile/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

## Will call

- gt_drupal_sso
- gt_drupal_theme (modified from gt's theme)
- hg (modified hg_reader)

Primarily tested on Plesk-based web hosting installations, but should work anywhere.
